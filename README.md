# CityMaster

*CityMaster* is a web application built during my internship to manage and display city information. The project features basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and introduces a unique left-right column swap operation to organize city data.

## Features
- **City List Display**: The app displays a list of city records, including the city code, city name, and options to edit or delete each entry.
- **Left and Right Columns**: City records are initially added to the right column by default.
- **Move City Between Columns**: Each city record has an action button labeled "Move to Left" when itâ€™s in the right column. Clicking this button moves the city to the left column, and the button changes to "Move to Right." The reverse happens for cities in the left column.
- **Move All Records**: There are two buttons at the top of the table: "Move All to Left" and "Move All to Right," which allow users to move all records between the left and right columns at once.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can add new cities, update existing ones, or delete them.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with a simple, user-friendly interface that enhances the management of city records.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Used for building the backend with the Model-View-Controller architecture.
- **SQL Server**: Used for storing city data in a relational database.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring and styling the front-end.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic interactions, such as handling the column swaps and updating the UI.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for styling and ensuring the application is responsive and looks good on various devices.

## How It Works
- **City Record Layout**: The city records are displayed in two columns:
  - **Left Column**: Initially empty or contains selected city records moved from the right.
  - **Right Column**: Contains new city records by default.
  
  Each city record has an action button:
  - **"Move to Left"**: Moves the city from the right column to the left column and changes the button to **"Move to Right"**.
  - **"Move to Right"**: Moves the city from the left column to the right column and changes the button to **"Move to Left"**.

- **"Move All to Left"**: Moves all city records from the right column to the left column.
- **"Move All to Right"**: Moves all city records from the left column to the right column.

## Database Schema
The following tables are used in the database:

- **City**: Stores information about cities.
  - `cityId` (Primary Key)
  - `cityName`
